# xrtm-forecast Roadmap

**Philosophy**: We build the engine, not the car.
**Goal**: To be the definitive "Institutional Grade" framework for generative forecasting.

## I. The Strategic Pillars

We organize our roadmap into three distinct layers of maturity.

| Pillar | Focus | Target Audience | Key Metaphor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Core "Physics"** | Validity, Math, Time | Quants, Engineers | The Gravity |
| **II. Research Grade** | SOTA Architectures | Academic Researchers | The Lab |
| **III. Experimental** | Niche & Future | Traders, Hobbyists | The Frontier |

## II. Release Plan

### v0.3.0: The Core Physics (Released)
*Focus: Establishing the fundamental scientific validity of the engine.*

| Feature | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chronos Protocol** | **Zero-Leakage Time Travel.** Enforced `before_date` cutoffs to prevent look-head bias during backtests. | **DONE** |
| **Calibration Engine** | **Probabilistic Rigor.** Platt Scaling and Brier Scores. | **DONE** |
| **Sentinel Protocol** | **Dynamic Trajectories.** Forecast Trajectories mapping confidence over time. | **DONE** |
| **Recursive Consensus** | **Disagreement Resolution.** supervisor-led refinement loops. | **DONE** |

### v0.4.0: The "Sovereign" Layer (Institutional Grade)
*Focus: Trust, Auditability, and Anti-Manipulation.*

| Feature | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Truth Protocol** | **Cryptographic Audit.** Merkle-ized reasoning chains for tamper-evident traces. | Planned |
| **Epistemic Security** | **Anti-Manipulation.** source verification and cross-referencing to block "News Injection" attacks. | Planned |
| **Dossier Generator** | **Institutional Reporting.** Auto-generating audit-ready research proofs. | Concept |

### v0.5.0: The "Intelligence" Layer (Frontier)
*Focus: Causal inference and automated optimization.*

| Feature | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Causal Reasoning** | **DAG Generation.** Moving from text lists to formal Directed Acyclic Graphs (SCMs). | Experimental |
| **Prompt Compiler** | **DSPy Integration.** Automated Brier-Score-driven optimization of system instructions. | Experimental |
| **Centaur Workbench** | **Human-Loop.** Optimized UX for human-agent collaboration. | Concept |
| **ABM Simulation** | **Market Dynamics.** Agent-based modeling for liquidity and impact analysis. | Experimental |

## III. How to Contribute

We prioritize features in **Pillar I** above all else. If you are looking to contribute:
1.  **High Impact**: Help us write adapters for the **Chronos Protocol** (e.g., adding `before_date` support to new search providers).
2.  **Medium Impact**: Add new "Topologies" to the **Consensus Engine**.
3.  **Low Impact**: Experimental features (unless you are willing to maintain them).

> **Note**: This roadmap is a living document. We prioritize scientific rigor over feature bloat.
