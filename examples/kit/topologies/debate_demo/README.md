# Debate Demo

**Script**: `run_debate_demo.py`

Demonstrates a "Topology" interaction pattern where two agents are tasked with debating a topic. A third "Judge" agent then evaluates the arguments to reach a conclusion.

## Usage

```bash
# From repository root
python3 examples/kit/topologies/debate_demo/run_debate_demo.py
```

## Concepts
- **Multi-Agent Interaction**: Agents conversing with each other, not just the user.
- **Dialectic Search**: Using opposing viewpoints to surface hidden information and reduce bias.
