# Slicing Demo

**Script**: `run_slicing_demo.py`

Demonstrates how to "slice" a complex problem into sub-problems, solve them in parallel, and re-aggregate the results. This is a map-reduce pattern for reasoning.

## Usage

```bash
# From repository root
python3 examples/kit/features/slicing_demo/run_slicing_demo.py
```

## Concepts
- **Decomposition**: Breaking a big question into smaller, independent questions.
- **Parallel Execution**: Running multiple agents simultaneously.
- **Aggregation**: Synthesizing multiple sub-answers into a final conclusion.
