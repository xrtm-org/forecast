# Skill Protocol

**Script**: `run_skill_protocol.py`

Illustrates the "Skill" concept: a modular, reusable capability that can be dynamically attached to an agent. Skills package prompt instructions and tools together.

## Usage

```bash
# From repository root
python3 examples/kit/features/skill_protocol/run_skill_protocol.py
```

## Concepts
- **Dynamic Capabilities**: Adding/removing skills at runtime.
- **Skill Packaging**: Encapsulating "How to do X" into a portable unit.
