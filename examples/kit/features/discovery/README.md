# Discovery Agent

**Script**: `run_discovery.py`

Demonstrates an agent capable of autonomous information retrieval. This usage pattern allows an agent to "learn" about a topic from scratch by generating search queries and synthesizing results.

## Usage

```bash
# From repository root
python3 examples/kit/features/discovery/run_discovery.py
```

## Concepts
- **Search Tooling**: Giving the agent access to a search engine.
- **Iterative Querying**: The agent refining its search based on initial results.
- **Synthesis**: Compiling scattered information into a coherent summary.
