# Enterprise Data Integration

**Script**: `run_enterprise_data.py`

Shows how to connect agents to structured enterprise data sources, such as internal databases or CSV extracts, rather than open web search.

## Usage

```bash
# From repository root
python3 examples/kit/features/enterprise_data/run_enterprise_data.py
```

## Concepts
- **Structured QA**: Asking questions against a defined schema.
- **Data Privacy**: Handling sensitive internal data within the reasoning loop.
