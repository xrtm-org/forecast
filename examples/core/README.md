# Core Examples (Primitives)

These examples demonstrate the fundamental building blocks of the `xrtm-forecast` reasoning engine. Developer should start here to understand the "Pure Core" architecture.

## Projects

### [orchestrator_basics](file:///workspace/forecast/examples/core/orchestrator_basics/run_orchestrator_basics.py)
Demonstrates how to register nodes and edges to build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for reasoning.

### [state_management](file:///workspace/forecast/examples/core/state_management/run_state_management.py)
Shows how `BaseGraphState` evolved through the graph, carrying context, reports, and token usage.
